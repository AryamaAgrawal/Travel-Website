The purpose of this project is to explore the benefits of cloning MakeMyTrip, a popular travel booking website. By creating a clone of MakeMyTrip, businesses can significantly reduce their development costs and time-to-market while improving the user experience for their customers.
Through extensive research and analysis, we have identified several successful clones of MakeMyTrip that have achieved great results. These clones have been able to attract a large user base and generate significant revenue, proving the viability of this approach.
